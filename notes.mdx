# Checkout

## TODO (pre how to roll checkout discussion - phase 1)

- check CheckoutStepsSetGuard with b2b entry point and with super query
- multiple calls for setting cost center (user cost centers emits multiple times)
- JaloError retry for super query (add retry for it)

  ```json
  {
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "item 8796098958229 no longer valid (was removed): object no longer valid",
        "type": "JaloObjectNoLongerValidError"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- unify combineLatest with userId and cartId for all c&q in checkout services
- better organize code related to order type clearing (constructor in checkout.service.ts - reuse query reset events?)
- consistent naming on facade methods returing state (should include state in name?)
- optimize mutliple query events reloads/resets (to avoid cancelled requests)

## TODO (without pair programming)

- normalizer for checkout state
- create event for Cart Merge (guessing cart effect?)

## TODO (details nice to have in actual spartacus release of new checkout)

- why we LoadCart on failed clearDeliveryMode call
- clearCheckoutDeliveryMode actually incremented/decremented cart process

- try to remove all store dispatches from checkout services
- outlet for order-confirmation-thank-you component (to avoid exteding)
- normalize naming of files/exported things from scheduled replenishment and b2b entry point
- schematics for scheduled replenishment
- clear fields in occ endpoint configs that are no longer needed
- check feature config service in constructors
- adapter normalize error for delivery mode query PR
- error handling for delivery mode query PR for query
- getSelectedDeliveryMode was not working in supported delivery modes PR (basically code from review-submit component)
- put TODO to remove actions from setDeliveryAddressCommand after supported delivery modes query merged
- express checkout needs supported delivery modes query state (new method in service needed) - do in supported delivery mode processes PR
- move default-b2b-occ-config to b2b checkout entry point
- try to reproduce payment hasError reponse
- ask Bill about desired express checkout behaviour (should we always assign defaults or should we preserve user's selected options)
- should we rename checkout events with `Checkout` prefix?
- paymentTypes.\* translations in assets (should be in feature libs?)

# Next session

- check the `DeliveryModeClearedEvent`
- TODOs in:
  - feature-libs/checkout/core/facade/checkout-query.service.ts
  - constructor in feature-libs/checkout/scheduled-replenishment/core/facade/checkout-scheduled-replenishment.service.ts
- check all e2e tests (express checkout fails since we changed delivery mode processes)
- smooth checkout UI (loading states etc.)

### Checkout lib structure

- root
- occ
- core
- components

- b2b // augment @spartacus/checkout/root { CheckoutState }
