- branches:
  - epic/checkout-refactor-c-and-q
  - feature/base-entry-point
  - feature/b2b-checkout-entry-point
  - feature/checkout-scheduled-replenishement-entry-point

1. implement unit tests
   - b2b entry point
   - scheduled replenishment entry point
   - checkout base entry point
   - takeActiveCartId in `projects/core/src/cart/facade/active-cart.service.ts`
2. styles in the base checkout?
3. Deprecate the existing components
4. add js doc comments
5. Checkout base:
   1. feature-libs/checkout/base/public_api.ts - populate
   2. types in:
      1. feature-libs/checkout/base/core/connectors/delivery-modes/converters.ts
      2. feature-libs/checkout/base/core/connectors/payment/converters.ts
      3. create a converter for the delivery-address
6. feature-libs/checkout/base/core/facade/checkout-delivery-address.service.ts, feature-libs/checkout/base/core/facade/checkout-payment.service.ts and feature-libs/checkout/base/core/facade/checkout-delivery-modes.service.ts - check the usage of the store
7. align the event names - start with Checkout?
8. augment checkoutsteptype enum in b2b - feature-libs/checkout/b2b/root/augmented-models/augmented-types.ts and feature-libs/checkout/b2b/root/augmented-models/index.ts
9. register b2b defaultB2bCheckoutConfig somewhere within the b2b entrypoint?
10. check ll of: base checkout, b2b, replenishment
11. move event listeners to /root? this means the feature will be ll if an event occurs before it is actually loaded. and this is what we want actually. consider the following scenario:
    1.  a user started the checkout, entered their delivery address, and set the delivery mode. This is set on the back-end for the active cart.
    2.  the user changes their mind, and navigates away from the checkout page to homepage, and refresh the browser.
    3.  after it, they decide to change their address in the profile menu. 
    4.  if they now start the checkout (and LL the feature), the current back-end data is _not_ valid for the active cart - we must reset the set delivery mode, and load the supported delivery modes again for the new address.
    5.  if the lister was in the root module, it can listen to the userupdateaddress event, ll the checkout, and issue a reset query event
